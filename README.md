# StompBox : A Deployer for TorqueBox

StompBox is a simple Sinatra app that can be used to manage deployments on [TorqueBox][torquebox] by accepting commit notifications from [GitHub][github]. It provides a user interface for managing one-click deployment and undeployment of your github repositories to TorqueBox for specific branches and commit points.

## Why?

StompBox is useful for testing and development environments where your code is changing frequently and you want to quickly deploy working branches and staging instances.  It integrates with your [GitHub][github] repositories to enable extremely quick and simple app deployment of any Rack-based application.  And it does all this on top of the industrial-strength TorqueBox platform, automatically providing your application with enterprise-level functionality such as messaging, scheduling, tasks, clustering and more.

## Installation

If you don't already have a TorqueBox instance installed, you should do that first.  Head on over to the [TorqueBox][torquebox] web site and follow the detailed instructions for downloading, installing, configuring and running TorqueBox.  Don't worry - it's easy. 

StompBox hasn't been tested on Windows and will probably not work in that environment. However, if you are running a Unix-y system such as Fedora or Mac OSX, then you should be fine.  

Once you've installed TorqueBox, clone the StompBox repository, install the gems, and deploy it to your running TorqueBox instance.

    $ git clone git@github.com:lance/stompbox.git
    Cloning into stompbox...
    remote: Counting objects: 187, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (168/168), done.
    remote: Total 187 (delta 108), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Receiving objects: 100% (187/187), 22.96 KiB, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (108/108), done.

    $ cd stompbox && bundle install
    <output clipped for brevity - you should see this at the end>
    Your bundle is complete! It was installed into /path/to/gem/home
    
    $ rake torquebox:deploy
    
## Configuration

Configuration options are found in config/stompbox.yml.  Here are some things you'll want to pay attention to.

* **database** Provide a URI for connecting to your database.  By convention, StompBox uses a database called "stompbox", but you can change this to whatever you want as long as it is supported by DataMapper. Be sure the user specified in the connection URI has appropriate privileges for executing DDL on your database. When the app starts for the first time, the tables will be created and it will fail if your user doesn't have the proper permissions.

* **deployments** When you deploy an application using StompBox, it clones the git repository into this directory. Make sure that your TorqueBox instance is running as a user with enough privileges to write to this directory.  

* **api_key** This should be set to something unguessable like an SHA1 hash. You can generate these any number of ways. Here's one one way to do it.

    `$ echo "Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York" | openssl sha1`
    
    `(stdin)= e4ba3556d1d059e2eadca9488b093d6685657e00`
    
* **repositories** Here you specify what repositories we're managing, and the branches on those repositories which we care about.  Add as many as you want.

## Usage

Once you've got everything configured and deployed, you can start managing your repositories.  From [GitHub][github], browse to the repository admin screen for one of the repositories you specified in `config/stompbox.yml`. Select "Service Hooks" -> "Post Receive URLs" and enter your StompBox URL plus your api_key (you configured it didn't you?).  It should look something like this.

    http://stompbox.mydomain.com/3821A95D456134214FAD6FA91A2BAFE574D47151
    
After you save your settings, testing the service hook should send a POST request to your StompBox.  Play around. 

## Caveats

This project is very immature and there are many features which are outstanding (such as authentication).  You should **not** use it in a production environment.  It is currently used for research, development and testing only.
